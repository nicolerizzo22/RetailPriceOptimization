## ðŸ’²Retail Price Optimization ðŸ’²

#### Optimizing retail prices means finding the perfect balance between the price you charge for your products and the number of products you can sell at that price.

#### The ultimate aim is to charge a price that helps you make the most money and attracts enough customers to buy your products. It involves using data and pricing strategies to find the right price that maximizes your sales and profits while keeping customers happy.

Retail price optimization involves determining the optimal selling price for products or services to maximize revenue and profit. In this project, we will walk through the task of Retail Price Optimization with Machine Learning using Python.

For the task of Retail Price Optimization, we will need data about the prices of products or services and everything that affects the price of a product. There is a great data set for our exploration that you can download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srivarshan53/retail-price).

Some of the tasks we will tackle:
- Importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset
- Reveiwing the data for null values
- Looking at the descriptive statistics of the data
- Looking at the distribution of the prices of the products
- Looking at the distribution of the unit prices using a box plot
- Looking at the relationship between quantity and total prices
- Looking at the average total prices by product categories
- Looking at the distribution of total prices by weekday using a box plot
- Looking at the distribution of total prices by holiday using a box plot
- Looking at the correlation between the numerical features with each other using a heatmap
- Calculating the average competitor price difference by product category
- Train a Machine Learning model for the task of Retail Price Optimization
- Make predictions and have a look at the predicted retail prices and the actual retail prices

### ðŸ’² Summary:
The ultimate aim of optimizing retail prices is to charge a price that helps you make the most money and attracts enough customers to buy your products. It involves using data and pricing strategies to find the right price that maximizes your sales and profits while keeping customers happy. I hope you enjoyed this project on optimizing retail prices with Machine Learning using Python.
